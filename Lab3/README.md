## Overview

### What's the Goal of the Code?

    The program needs to get the following done:
    - Print an introductory statement/text block. This text block needs to tell the user what to enter for which option to be shown.
    - Continue to take inputs and print corresponding outputs until the exit text is entered.
    - Remember how many times a valid input was entered.
    - Print a statement using the input counter at the end of the exit before gracefully exiting.
    
    In addition, I want to implement the following for ease of code debugging and smoother operation:
    - A loop function that calls on other reader/printer and checker functions.
    - A reader or checker that can differentiate between a string and an integer, and set a flag to let other functions know which is present.
    - A feature addition that allows the user to enter an arbitrary invalid integer or string input to bring up a message indicating invalid input. The message will advise the user to bring up the options or exit.
    - An options function triggered on corresponding input that allows the user to see the options again.
    - Modularity: The program must be easily modifiable as to allow new options to be added with minimal changes to the program logic. In this case, the program should be able to add or subtract options merely by changes to the .data section.
